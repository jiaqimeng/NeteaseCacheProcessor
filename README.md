# NeteaseCacheProcessor by Richard Meng

Extracting songs from local netease music cache.

Please make sure that you have a reliable internete connection and the netease music app installed!

Guide:
  1. Download the executable file
  2. Double click the downloaded file
  3. If everything goes fine, there will be a window popped up printing "Processing songs"
  4. Wait(this depends on how many songs need to be processed)
  5. Check the NeteaseCacheMusic folder on your desktop
  6. Enjoy
  
One more thing, do not delete the hidden file in that folder. It simply remembers the songs that have been processed before and avoid re-processing these songs next time.
