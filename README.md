Please make sure that you have a reliable internet connection and the Netease music app installed!

Guide:
  1. Download the executable file (the one without any suffix)
  2. Double click the downloaded file
  3. If everything goes fine, there will be a window popped up printing "Processing songs"
  4. Wait(this depends on how many songs need to be processed)
  5. Check the NeteaseCacheMusic folder on your desktop
  6. Enjoy
  
Tip:
  1. Please make sure that the cached songs are "fully cached" (a complete song). If you find any song that breaks suddenly when it's playing, please go back to netease music app and play that specific music until the caching progress bar reaches 100%. Then go to the NeteaseCacheMusic folder, DELETE that song and repeat Guide 2.
  
One more thing, do not delete the hidden file in that folder. It simply remembers the songs that have been processed before and avoid re-processing these songs next time.
